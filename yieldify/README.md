# Yieldify - DeFi Yield Optimizer
**Maximize Your DeFi Returns with AI-Driven Liquidity Pool Management**

DeFi Yield Optimizer is an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) solution, designed to optimize user investments in Uniswap V3 liquidity pools. By leveraging an off-chain AI agent, the system continuously analyzes pool data based on user-defined criteria, such as liquidity, fee tier, and trading volume, to ensure the best pool selection for each user.

### Features
- Customizable User Investment Strategies:
  - Users can define their desired pool characteristics, including:
    - **Fee Tier**: Select from low or high fee tiers (e.g., 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%).
    - **Liquidity**: Choose pools with minimum or maximum liquidity.
    - **Volume**: Set the desired trading volume range.

- Automated Yield Optimization:
  - An off-chain AI agent runs continuously, querying the Uniswap V3 subgraph for real-time data, analyzing pools, and selecting the most optimal pool based on the user's parameters.
  - The bot automatically invests the user's funds into the selected pool and periodically rebalances the funds if better opportunities arise.

- Real-Time Data Analysis: The system queries for liquidity pool data every minute, ensuring that investment decisions are based on the most up-to-date information.
- Seamless Withdrawals: Users can withdraw their funds, including accrued returns, at any time directly from the Vault contract, providing complete flexibility.
- Idle Fund Protection: If no pool meets the user's criteria, their funds remain idle in the contract, avoiding suboptimal investments.
### Architecture
1. Vault Contract:
   - Tracks user deposits, invested pool addresses, and accumulated returns.
   - Handles user deposits, withdrawals, and ensures that funds are only invested in pools that meet the specified criteria.
2. Off-Chain AI Agent:
   - Continuously queries the Uniswap V3 subgraph for pool data.
   - Analyzes pool conditions based on liquidity, volume, fee tiers, and other factors using statistical models.
   - If a better pool is found, the bot withdraws funds from the current pool and reinvests them in the new, optimal pool.
3. Smart Contract Security:
   - The Vault contract is designed to be secure, with mechanisms for safe deposits and withdrawals.
   - Proper reentrancy protection, access control, and auditing are key to ensuring the system’s robustness.
4. Future Improvements:
   - Expand AI’s analysis with machine learning models to predict pool yields more accurately.
   - Integrate additional DeFi protocols and liquidity pools to diversify investment options.
   - Improve gas efficiency and transaction batching for better scalability.

### Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development for managing user investments and yields.
- **Python**: AI agent written in Python, utilizing aiohttp for asynchronous API calls and statistical models for pool analysis.
- Uniswap V3: Liquidity pool management and yield generation.
- Graph Protocol: Querying Uniswap V3 pool data through The Graph's Subgraph APIs.
